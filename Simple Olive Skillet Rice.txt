Simple Olive Skillet Rice

1 or 2 small cans sliced black olives
White or brown rice
Olive oil
Kosher or course salt

Cook rice according to package directions.

Add at least a couple of tablespoons of olive oil to a skillet. Heat oil slightly. Add rice, olives (drained), and a dash of salt. Stir and heat until the rice shows the color of the olive oil (add a bit if needed), and begins to brown.

Serve with steak, pork chops, roast beef, etc.
