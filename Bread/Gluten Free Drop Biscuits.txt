Gluten-Free Easy Drop Biscuits

Ingredients

1 stick of butter, melted. (Put it in the microwave for 40 seconds to melt it.)
2 and 1/2 cups of white rice flour
1 cup tapioca flour
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 and 1/2 cups milk

Mix all ingredients together in a bowl until well blended. Drop by spoonfuls onto cookie sheets, and bake at 400 degrees F for 15 to 20 minutes, or until done to taste. (For crispier biscuits, leave them in longer.)

Makes 2 dozen biscuits.

Coconut flour variation:
Reduce rice flour to 2 cups, and add ½ cup coconut flour. Increase milk to 2 cups. Add the last half cup slowly, stirring as you add it, until dough is the right consistency-smooth with no flour remaining unmixed. You may not need the full 2 cups to do this, but it should be close.

Bake as directed above.

Freezing: Biscuits can be dropped onto the cookie sheets, then frozen. Once frozen, remove from cookie sheets and store in ziplock bags. Bake as directed above, but add about 5 minutes to baking time. (Note: this is not fully tested yet, but it will be soon.)
