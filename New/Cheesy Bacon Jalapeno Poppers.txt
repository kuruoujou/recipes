Ingredients:
20 jalapenos
1 bag of bacon crumbles (or 1/2 lb. of cooked/chopped bacon)
1 brick cream cheese (or low-fat cream cheese)
3 c. shredded cheddar
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
salt (to taste)

Instructions:
Halve and seed the peppers, then boil the halves for about 5 mins to soften
them slightly and take away a tad of the heat. In the meantime, mix all the
other ingredient EXCEPT for the bacon and put the mix in the fridge for at
least a half-hour. Drain peppers and cool on a towel. When cooled, fill each
pepper with the cream cheese mixture then top with crumbled bacon. Bake at 350
for about 15 mins or until bubbly. If there are every any leftover (hardly
ever), they are GREAT chopped up and put into scrambled eggs the next day.
