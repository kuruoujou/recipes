Quick and Easy Shoyu Ramen

Ingredients

15-18 oz Chuka Soba cooked to package directions (see notes for substitutions)
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tbsp grated fresh ginger
7 cups chicken or vegetable broth
1 cup water
3 tbsp mirin (or 3 tbsp sake + 1 tbsp sugar see notes for substitution)
½ cup soy sauce (use a naturally brewed one, recommend Kikkoman or Yamasa)
½ cup chopped green onion
shredded nori (optional)

Directions

Put the water, chicken broth, soy sauce, garlic, mirin and ginger in a pot
and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 15
minutes.

Put the cooked noodles into a bowl. Ladle the broth over the noodles to
the desired amount. Top with chopped green onion and shredded nori if
desired.

Notes:

If you can not find Chuka Soba, you could substitute the same amount of
chow mein noodles (not the deep fried/crunchy ones) or thin spaghetti
cooked slightly past the al dente stage.

Another substitute for mirin is sherry, or even just sugar
