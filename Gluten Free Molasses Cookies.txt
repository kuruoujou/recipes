Gluten Free Molasses Cookies


Wet Ingredients:

1 1/2 cups of butter (this equals 3 sticks)
2 eggs
1/2 cup molasses
2 cups brown sugar

Dry Ingredients:

5 1/3 cups of rice flour
2 teaspoons cinnamon
1 teaspoon ground cloves
2 teaspoons ginger
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 teaspoons of baking soda

Put all the wet ingredients into the mixing bowl. Cream the ingredients together at low to medium speed until smooth. Add dry ingredients and mix. Chill dough in refrigerator for 30 minutes. Roll into small balls and dip in white sugar. Place on greased cookie sheet, and flatten with a fork. Bake at 375F for 8 minutes.

If first batch of cookies comes out of the oven, and they have flattened too much as they baked, add a little more rice flour and stir by hand.
