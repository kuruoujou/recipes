Almond Flour Brownies

Ingredients

3/4 cup Bob's Red Mill Almond Meal/Flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoons Penzey's dutch process unsweetened cocoa powder
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 cup organic sugar (1/3 cup stevia)
3 large organic eggs
1 teaspoon gluten free vanilla
1/2 cup organic butter
3/4 cup chocolate chips (divided 1/2 cup and 1/4 cup)

Instructions

* Preheat your oven to 350 degrees
* In a separate bowl, melt together 1/2 cup chocolate chips with the butter. When melted, whisk to combine well. Set aside to cool slightly.
* Mix together the almond flour, salt, cocoa powder, and baking powder and set aside.
* Beat together the eggs, sugar, and vanilla
* Slowly pour the slightly cooled melted chocolate and butter into the egg/sugar mixture while mixing until fully incorporated. Don’t add too fast so that the raw eggs don’t cook upon contact.
* Add the dry ingredients to the chocolate mixture and mix completely.
* Pour the batter in a sprayed 8 x 8 pan (I use coconut oil)
* Sprinkle the top with the remaining 1/4 cup chocolate chips and gently press it into the batter.
* Bake for 30 minutes or until a toothpick poked into the center comes out clean.
* Cool completely and devour!
