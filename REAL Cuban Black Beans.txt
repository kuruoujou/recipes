Ingredients:

4 Cans black beans undrained

1 Medium Sweet Onion

2 Medium red peppers

3 Packets Goya Sazon (I used the Cilantro and Tomato variety)

2 Tblsp Cumin

2 Tblsp Oregano

3 Bay leaves

4 Tblsp finely chopped garlic

4 Dried red chili peppers, finely chopped (about 1 Tblsp)

1/2 Cup oil

1/2 Cup white cooking wine

2 Limes

Instructions:

Mix dried chili peppers into the white wine and set aside.

In a large sauce pan over medium heat, sauté the onion and red peppers in the oil. When the onions are softened, mix in the garlic. sauté a few minutes, enough to mix the flavors.

Add the wine/chili mixture to the sauté. Let it cook for a minute or two. Add the black beans undrained to the sauté. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 5 minutes.

Mix in oregano, cumin, bay leaves, and Goya Sazon. Stir well until spices are evenly mixed. Let simmer for 2 minutes then transfer to a crock pot. Cook in crock pot on high setting for 3 hours, stirring every 30 minutes.

Add lime juice, mix well, and serve over rice.
