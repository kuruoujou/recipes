Gluten-Free Pancakes

Ingredients:

1 cup rice flour
1/2 cup tapioca flour
3 tablespoons sugar
1 tablespoon gluten free baking powder (Buy from a health food store.)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum (also from the health food store)
2 eggs
1/2 cup half and half
1/2 cup water

Mix dry ingredients. Add eggs, and stir. Add half and half (milk can also be used) and water. Stir until well mixed. If the batter is too thin, add a bit of rice flour. If the batter is too thick, add some water-just a bit at a time. The batter should be well blended, but will still have some lumps. It should be a little thick, but liquid enough to pour.

Spray skillet with non-stick cooking spray. (I use Spectrum brand olive oil spray.) Place skillet over medium heat. Use a soup ladle to pour batter into skillet. Turn pancakes when the batter starts to bubble on the top. Makes 10 to 12 pancakes.
