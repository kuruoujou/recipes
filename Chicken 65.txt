Boneless chicken,cut into 1½ inch cubes     450 grams
Yogurt                                      1/2 cup
Lemon juice                                 1 1/2 tablespoons
Rice flour                                  2 tablespoons
Salt                                        to taste
Oil                                         6 tablespoons

For masala  
Dried red chillies                          4
Ginger                                      2 inch piece
Garlic                                      6 cloves
Coriander seeds                             2 tablespoons
Black peppercorns                           12-15

Grind the ingredients of the masala to a fine paste. Mix the yogurt, lemon
juice, rice flour, salt and two tablespoons oil into the ground masala paste.
Coat the chicken with the masala paste and marinate for an hour in a
refrigerator. Heat the remaining oil in a thick-bottomed kadai; add the chicken
pieces in small batches of six to eight pieces and stir-fry over high heat for
one minute, tossing continuously. Add another batch of the chicken and repeat.
Lower heat once all the chicken has been added. Turn the pieces frequently,
basting with the remaining masala. Cook till the oil separates and the chicken
turns crispy on the outside, but moist and soft on the inside. Adjust salt,
toss well and remove. Drain and serve hot.
