Olive-Onion Pasta Salad


Ingredients:

1. Dried pasta of your choice. (Gluten-free pasta works well. Tyinkyada is a good brand.)
2. Olive oil.
3. Balsamic vinegar, or a gourmet vinegar of your choice. 
4. Cherry tomatoes.
5. 1, 1 1/2 ounce can of sliced black olives.
6. About 1/3 of a large onion, diced.
7. Dried basal. 

Cook pasta according to package directions. Cool. Mix oil and vinegar in the
following proportions-1 part olive oil to two parts vinegar. Don't mix a large
quantity of dressing to start- 1/4 cup oil to 1/2 cup vinegar will be enough dressing for a medium sized bowl of salad. Add diced onion, drained olives, and cherry tomatoes, sliced in two, to pasta. Use as many or as few tomatoes as you like. Sprinkle on basil and add dressing. Stir. Add more basil until the salad has nice green-flecked appearance, or to taste. Refrigerate for at least a couple of hours before serving.

Before serving, stir the salad. If the pasta is dry, add more dressing. Leave the vinegar on the table, and each person can add a dash or two to taste.

Preparation note: You can cook the pasta in advance and then refrigerate until ready to finish the salad. Just stir in a small amount of olive oil, enough to stop the pasta from clumping.
