Gluten Free Mac and Cheese

Ingredients:

1 and 1/2 package of rice macaroni (I prefer Tinkyada brand.) Cook as directed, until just soft. (Don't overcook, if possible.)

1 16 ounce package of sharp cheddar cheese-a full block of all-natural cheese, not pre-shredded.

4 ounces of cream cheese. Read labels-store brands tend to have less ingredients in the cream cheese than national brands, and this is preferred.

3 to 4 slices of all-natural cheddar cheese. (Store brands are best for this.)

1 and 1/2 cups milk.

Directions:

Cook the pasta as directed, and drain. Rinse the pasta with cold water to remove extra starch. 

Shred the cheddar block using a food processor. 

Pour the pasta into a baking dish, add shredded cheese and stir. Soften cream cheese slightly in the microwave (20 to 30 seconds) and mix this into the pasta as well. 

Add milk. Top with sliced cheddar cheese. 

Bake at 350 degrees F for 30 to 40 minutes, or until fully heated, with the cheese on top turning a bit golden brown.

Remove from oven and let set at least 5 minutes. Serve, and enjoy!
