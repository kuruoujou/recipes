350 grams Aherns’ all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
230 grams (2 US sticks) unsalted butter
1/2 cup ice-cold water, plus a few splashes more

Preparing to make the dough.
Cut the butter into one-inch cubes. Put them in the freezer for 15 minutes.

Making the dough.
Put the flour and salt into a large food processor. Pulse them together until
the flour is fluffy and aerated.

Add the butter cubes. Pulse ten times. (Count loudly, and firmly: one! two!
three! as though you are a toddler proud to know how to say these numbers.) At
this point, the flour and butter should look like a sandy mixture, with the
butter chunks still visible.

Pour in the ½ cup of ice-cold water. Pulse five times. Look at the dough. If
it still looks a bit dry, add a splash more water, not exceeding another ¼
cup. The finished dough should like curds of dry cottage cheese. (See
photograph above.) Stop adding water.

Forming the dough into a disk.
Dump the dough onto a clean, cool surface. (We love our marble pastry board.)
Gently gather all the dough together in your hands. Working quickly, take half
the dough, make it into a ball, then flatten it into a plump disk, about 2
inches tall. Wrap it in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for
30 minutes. Do the same with the remaining dough.

(Now let’s be honest here. If you want, you could roll out the dough
immediately. Sure, the dough is better when you let it rest, because the
flours hydrate more fully. But if you’re in a rush, you can roll out the
dough immediately, if you work quickly.)
