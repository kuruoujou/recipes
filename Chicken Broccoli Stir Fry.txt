Chicken Broccoli Stir Fry

Ingredients:

12 boneless, skinless chicken breast. (All natural chicken, either Perdue brand, or purchase at a meat market.)

Blood orange olive oil, or regular olive oil.

2 packages frozen of broccoli cuts.

1 package of frozen broccoli florets.

1 package frozen sugar snap peas.

2 large cans of mandarin oranges. (I think these are 14 ounces. Kroger brand has fewer ingredients than national brands.)

Rice. (3 cups water to 1 and 1/2 cups rice.)

Corn starch or tapioca flour.

Directions:

Cook rice as directed.

Cut chicken breasts into approximately 1 inch cubes-not precise pieces-and remove all fat and gristle. 

Add olive oil to skillets (2 will be needed, for this makes a lot of stir fry) to coat.

Start cooking chicken over medium heat, while microwaving veggies as directed. (Usually, one package takes 7 minutes.) As each package of veggies is done, pour the hot veggies into a large plastic bowl. Keep cooking chicken until cooked through, as you continue to cook veggies.

Once chicken is cooked, turn off heat and finish cooking veggies. 

Drain the mandarin orange juice into a bowl. (Or two, one for each skillet.)

Add veggies to skillets. Add one can of mandarin oranges, without the juice, to the top of each skillet. Turn on medium heat and stir to continue to heat through. Add salt and pepper to taste, if desired.

Add a couple tablespoons of thickening flour (corn starch or tapioca flour) to the bowl(s) with the mandarin orange juice. Stir until mixed, then divide and add to skillets. Stir over heat until thickened. (Note: You may need to add more if mixture does not thicken enough the first time out.)

Serve immediately over rice.
