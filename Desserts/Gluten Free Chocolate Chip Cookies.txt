Gluten Free Chocolate Chip Cookies


Wet Ingredients:

1 1/2 cups of butter (this equals 3 sticks)
4 eggs
1 cups brown sugar
1 cup white sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla. (McCormick's is gluten free, as are others sold in health food stores.)

Dry Ingredients:

4 cups of rice flour-brown or white. (This is basically one package of rice flour.)
1 1/2 cups tapioca flour.
2 teaspoons of baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 to 3 packages of chocolate chips.

Put all the wet ingredients into the mixing bowl. Cream the ingredients together at low to medium speed until smooth. Add dry ingredients and mix. Add tablespoons of water to moisten mixture if it is too dry and crumbly. Stir in chocolate chips (you can use a mixer if it can handle the load, or stir by hand.) Bake at 350F for 8 minutes, or until golden.

The cookies will look golden in the oven when done, but will still look puffy and soft. Remove them from the oven, and let them cool for 5 minutes. The cookies should firm up, and you can remove them from the pan.
