Beef and Onion Stir Fry

Ingredients:

3-4 pounds of thin cut steak. (You'll need a number of packages-whatever looks best.)

2 onions, coarsely chopped. 

Olive oil.

Soy sauce substitute: 1-2 tablespoons of molasses. 1-2 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar. 1 teaspoon of sugar.

Corn starch.

Rice.

Directions:

Cook rice as directed. (For a family of 4, I use 3 cups of water and 1 and 1/2 cups of rice.)

Slice steak into strips, about 1/2 inch wide by 3-4 inches long. Remove extra fat and gristle. 

Pour olive oil into skillet, enough to coat the bottom of the pan. (Not a big puddle-just a coating.) Add steak, and cook over medium to high heat until meat is brown.

Add onions, and all ingredients for soy sauce substitute. Stir to coat meat with molasses and spread the brown color. Cook on medium heat until onions are translucent. Add two to three tablespoons of corn starch to a bowl with a small amount of water. Stir until blended. Add corn starch and water mixture to stir fry. Stir until mixture thickens. 

Serve immediately over rice. Enjoy!
